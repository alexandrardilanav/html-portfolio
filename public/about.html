<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey! I'm Alexandra Ardila, I'm an economist and I started learning how to build web pages few time ago.
  I'm currently working as data analyst, but I'd like to explore way more fields and having fun in another ones.
</p>

<p>I'm really excited about keep learning and improving my skills for the future within the different IT fields.</p>

<p>Hope this new knowledge brings a lot of joy and opportunities for me! :)</p>
