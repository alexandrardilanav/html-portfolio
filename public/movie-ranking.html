<h1>The best movies according to Alexandra</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>It's such a good Sci-Fi movie. Reflects the way we dream and the conciousness of reality.</p>
<h3>Shutter Island</h3>
<p>Another sci-fi movie that relates how a psycological disease works. This movie plays with your mind and you get under the skin of the main character</p>
<h3>Shrek 2</h3>
<p>It's incredibly funny and the latin american dubbing is awesome. The stories are good written and each character has a unique personality that complements the whole twist perfectly.</p>
